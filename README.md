# Predicting Student Dropouts in Higher Education
March 2023

Developing a proof-of-concept approach to predicting student dropouts in higher education. Through Python developed optimized algorithms for Logistic Regression (iterative methods) and Support Vector Machines. FAMD and Random Foresting Analysis is also included.

**Logistic Regression**: Evaluated Gradient Descent Approach and Newton's Method Approach (through different matrix decomposition method)

**Support Vector Machines**: Evaluated many different Kernel Methods.
